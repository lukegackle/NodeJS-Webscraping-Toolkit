# NodeJS-Webscraping-Toolkit

This repository contains a group of templates for performing web scraping with nodejs, these templates are designed to be used in a Google Cloud environment as a Google Cloud function in a node.js environment, however you can certainly take this code and tweak it to work in different environments.

The three main templates this repository contains is as follows: 

* Web Scraping from cloudflare sites
* Web Scraping from regular sites
* Web Scraping from sites that require client side JavaScript to run

You can find more information about these templates at my blog including detailed guides to get them setup at [Lukes Toolkit](https://lukestoolkit.blogspot.com)
